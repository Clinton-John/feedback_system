what to be done next, before and all the features to be added 

when clicking an organization field then the field also has an id which needs to be set when 

in the views when handling the login into a website, retreive the organization based on the inserted email and then using the email get the organization id and pass it together with the link to the organization. --DONE  

-->> Next Ensure that the users who logs into the organization insterts both their email and the organizations email to confirm if they are registered to the organization or not
-->> add the user who is logged in to the website and display their profile. that is the admin who is inside the admins dashboard and accessing the information

-->> out of all of the administrators, the user with the name admin is the only one allowed to delete the administrators and add the administrators to the specific organization. the other administrators can only view and reply to the feedback sent by stakeholders and customers. 


--->>>> Updating the user profile. 
    the instance should be to the specific user
--->>> add the profile form and make it be visible


later ---> update the organizational profile
for the org profile, no need to create profile, instead, add all the fields and update directly

one form that will be the same for all of the registered organizations
the feedbacks can be shown in the admins page, and when clicked opens a new page with the full message sent

-- after the user is redirected to the individual message screen, have a link button that returns the user back to the initial page.
-- separate the users to see those that send their email and those who dont send their information. in the forms, set that if the feedback type is set to question then the user must submit their email

ADMINS PAGE 
    --> navbar with the number of feedbacks received
    --> button for each feedback type
    --> button for feedbacks with the emails
    --> display feedbacks as a room messages and each can be clicked
    --> feedback with emails allows the admin to write back the answer to the user

seting up the feedback types on the fisrt section
-- count each number of feedback based on the types

--ensure the users feedback returns the feedback messages based on the clicked 
switching to creating a model for the feedback type and relating it to the feedback using the foreign key

only admins of an organization can login to it 

generate the qr code specific to an organization --- done

add functionality to view, and download the generated qr code
for the qrcodes, they will be stored in the static folder and then the path added to the organizations database

check person trying to log in to the organizations page
super admin must login


                        SENDING EMAILS WHEN A NEW FEEDBACK IS SENT TO AN ORGANIZATION  
add the submited_to email section in all of the submitted user forms and auto embedd it in every submited feedback to make it easier and allow sending of email to the responsible organization

send email to show there is a received feedback -- Done
send email whenever there is a newly added organization -- Done
send email whenever a user creates an account, -- Done
send email whenever a user is added as an admin -- Done
send email whenever there is a log in to the organization -- Later


delete feedback, delete organization account, delete user account
DELETE ORGANIZATION  -- Done
delete user_account -- Done
delete feedback -- Done

delete in feedback page shouldnt redirect to home but it should be to the organizational admins page -- because the feedback is related to a specifc organization we can trace it back to the organization to make it work  
only the admins in the organization can delete the feature -- Done 

Implement a feature to allow users specify after what number of feedbacks should they receive an email
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ABOVE 
creating a new model to count the number of forms received and the email to send is only triggered when the count is reached 

Test if the feedback is specific to each and every organizational
check if the notification is checked if the specific number of emails is sent 

the above 2 work perfectly as needed and suggested

get the user specification of after how many emails they want to send

create a db value where user specifes it before, then in the signal, retreive the variable and then pass the variable to the condition. This is how they can allow for notification

allow for switching on and off. this can also be achieved through the database
a good aproach is creating a settings models to handle all of the above 


today
delete all the models, re write the notifications and test if it functions on a new database

Number of Notifications to be used in the signals.py file. if its set to yes then it should display. if no then it shouldnt display.
